## Habits for avoiding bugs in the first place
- run your code frequently (every time you make a change)
- make small changes and test along the way
- break big problems down into smaller manageable problems
- close things as soon as you open them (ends, html closing tags)
- watch your spelling
- don't guess at methods: read the docs!
- punctuation, syntax
- sanity checking (do something you know should work)
- read your code
- explain your code to someone

## Techniques for Fixing Bugs and Errors
- read the line number
- google the error message
- ask someone else
- know your common mistakes
- don't give up!
- give up temporarily 
- write it the long way/a different way (e.g. += vs = _ + _)
- write it again the same way
- walk through your code
- write pseudocode
